void element -> which have don't have any content.

h1-> 32px
h2->24px

Types of element on behaviour -> Block level element -> it will cover entire Depth of the ui > h1 -> height and width is apllicable > div,heading > start from the next line
Inline Element -> cover only actual space it take it will take depth of content> span-> height and width not use > span,a,input > start from the same line


Formating tag -> to format the content of text 
<physical tag>  <logical tag>

Types of Css -> 1. Inline CSS(using style attribute)
2. Internal -> style tag inside your head
3. External -> differnent file in other position(head -> link tag)

2&3 is depends on priority how much is close to html tag more close more less priority 

CSS line by line execution

CSS Selector-> class(.),id(#),tagname,grouping(,),universal selector(*)



CSS Units -> Absolute(it will not change)(px,inches,cm,mm)                  Relative->size is depend on the parent container
1px -> 1/92 inches															ex->em(parent related(div -> 5px , so child have 5*5px)),rem(html(16px) related),vh,vw use them for responsive

Text Properties -> to change appearance of text
text-colorc(Rgb(red,green,blue(0-255)),rgba(alpha(intensity)),hsl(hue saturation lightining),hexadecimal(#(0-9,A-F)(3,4,6,8 range is allowed)),hsla(alpha(1-360)))

Flex(one directional achivement)-> display:Flex
		justify content
		align item
		row reverse/col reverse
None

flex-> display,flex wrap->wrap,justify-content->space-between,space around,space evenly



											**JavaScript**




JavaScript -> high level object oriented programming language/dynimcally typed/.js extension/interpeted language
JavaScript is used for client side rendering/ synchronous in nature
JavaScript is single threaded

NextScape computer coorpartion
NextScape navigator(browser) lanaguage ->(brandon euch 1995) mocha->livescript->javascript->js(give to elcma(european computer manufacturing association))


Js give to js engine -> Parser(dividing the code into small chunks) -> Abstract Synthetical Tree(Ast)(store in the form ast)(give this code to interpeter)->interpeter->generate the byte code->machine code
																											|
																											JIT(Just in Time)(have profiler check for hot put which is repeating again again) used for performace optimization


Token -> Smallest unit of any programming language
1. Identifier : name given to the component of javascript(not should start with number,white space, special charcaters(expect $,_),follow nameing convention(kebaba Case, Camel Case, Snake Case,dot,hypen))
2. liberal/constant : the data present iniside your program(number,string,boolean)
3. Variable : 
4. Operator : Symbol which is used to perform some operation on operands 
 (arthimetic(+,-,%,/,*,^)),logical(&&,||,!),relational(<,>,<=),(Assignment(=),comparsion(==,===,!=,!==))
5.keyword->predefined not use as identifier and in lowercase

		declarition  initialize  declarition+intilization redeclartion reintilization redeclartion+reintilization scope 
 Var	yes				yes 				yes					yes			yes					yes					global

 let    yes             yes                 yes					no			yes					no					script

 const no				no					yes					no          no                  no                   script


console.log(a);
var a=10; //undefined
let,const -> refernece error(cannot acess it)->TDZ(temporal dead zone(this is the time gap between variable utilization and decalaration/inti))

hosting->utilizing the variable before its declartion and intilization(all upper thing is beacuse of hosting)




DataTypes->
		|
		primitive(number,string,boolean,undefined,symbol,null,BigInt)(immutable,call by value)
		non-primitive(function,array,object)(muttable,call by refernce)


String is way to use string-> " ",''(want to print ""),``(to declare multiple line)



						function
without calling the function it will not execute
identifier_name()->function calling/function invoking

function pop(a,b(parameter)->act as placeholder)
(10,20)->arguments


Type of Function->
Named -> function with identifier
arrow -> shortest way to write a function   ,, -> fat arrrow
higher order function -> function which accept other function as an argument
callback -> function which it pass as arguments

function with expression
anonymous function
nested function
recursive function
generator functiion
IIFE function(used before 2015)


implicit return possible with arrow function => return or a/hi
explicit we have to use return keyword when braces is used


hof->                                                          callback(){

																		}
function higher(callback){

}
higher(callback)



Array -> linear data structure/dynamic/heterogeneous(take different data)

object -> real word entity / objects are entity which represent key value pair
static method are access by object constructor have predefined method

consle is part of browser not of javascript

BOM->windows(global)->prompt(alert like)/provided by browser



html and js is different language so they do not understand anything so they need a mediator/tarnsalator (dom)

DOM->establish the relationship between html and js
dovument object model-it is an api(act like a bridge between two differnt languages)

Dom tree -> document -> html -> head(meta,title,link)
						|			
						body(div,p,list,span)

Access method in dom -> 
document.getElementById(),
document.getElementByClass(),
document.getElementByTagname(),
document.querySelector(),
document.querySelectorAll()

document.getElementById-> if two id with same name then it take first,if it is empty it give null

document.getElementByClass()-> gives html collection(array like object)(not array)
so for styling first convert html collection into array
if data is not present of class any it give emp ty collection

ForEach -> want a callback function,


document.querySelector()-> based on css selector(id,class,universal,tag,grouping) we target the  single elements and if not present it give null

document.querySelectorAll()-> it is for target group elements and it will give nodelist(array like object(but also not an array)) as it give nodelist but we can use array method on it


HTML Collection                                NodeList
Not use any array method without converting   Use without converting array functions
It is always live							  It is not live most timed
(as we make any changes in any element        (as we make any changes it keep to only effected node then we have to tell document node to tell it again)
it frequently live changes)       



										Events
					action performed by the user on ui
addEventListner('event',callback)

let nav=document.createElement("nav");
document.body.append(nav);

let ul=document.createElement("ul");
nav.append(ul);

async and await are keyword
fetch always return promise,async is used with function

as fetch give promise which is in form of response object so we have to convert it into object so we use await keyword also it take time
to load data, then data is come in object but all object are stored in array
